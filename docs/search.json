Lew, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Gabriel Grand, Vikash K. Mansinghka (see Figure 1 and Subsection 2.2).\nAt the moment, we demonstrate implementing the Sequential Monte Carlo algoritm on a specific case, the Hard Constraints case generating texts with only short words with a certain choice of M (the Markove kernel) and G (the potential function), not the most efficient one.\nThe main effort so far has been in tackling some of the caching challenges.\n\nsource: notebooks/index.clj",
